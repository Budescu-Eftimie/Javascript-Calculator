## What have i learned with this TOP assingment?

  Beside css and some js syntax i haven't searched for help online and even tough, it took me 20+ hours of work, spreaded on several days i learned that one should never give up and finally managed to finish the logic of the calculator on my on.
  I learned about event bubbling, and how functions interact with each other,really got a grip of [if..else](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) statements and javascript built in methods like __slice()__, __includes()__ .
  Had to refactor/rewrite my code multiple times and overall was a pretty hard assigment for a begginer it was fun it and i will come back at this project  in the future to make the code more readable.
